# YABA - Yet another blog app

A blog app seems like a staple of any aspiring developer's portfolio, and I am no exception.
Create blog posts using HTML and Markdown

Built using Node/Express, Ejs, and Bootstrap with MongoDB as our database.

Expansion ideas:  User/login system with individual blogs? Upvote/Downvote posts?
